Perfect is a complete and powerful toolbox, framework, and application server for Linux and macOS. It provides everything a Swift engineer needs for developing lightweight, maintainable, and scalable apps and other REST services entirely in the Swift programming language for both client-facing and server-side applications.

Built on a high-performance asynchronous networking engine, Perfect can also run on FastCGI, and it supports Secure Sockets Layer encryption. There are many other features including a suite of tools commonly required by internet servers such as WebSockets and iOS push notifications, but you are not limited to those options.

This guide is designed for developers at all levels of experience to get Perfect up and running quickly.
